Welcome to Torchflows documentation!
===================================

Torchflows is a library for generative modeling and density estimation using normalizing flows.
It implements many normalizing flow architectures and their building blocks for:

* easy use of normalizing flows as trainable distributions;
* easy implementation of new normalizing flows.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
